"""\
Search for expected peaks in mass spectrometry data.

Usage:
    mass_plus_me <expected_masses_csv> <mass_spectra_csv>... [options]
    mass_plus_me plot <mass_spectra_csv>...

Arguments:
    <expected_masses_csv>
        A *.csv file (as can be exported from Excel) containing a list of the 
        expected masses in its first column.  This program will generate a 
        report detailing how well each of these masses is supported by the 
        given data.

    <mass_spectra_csv>
        One or more *.csv files (as can be exported from the instrument) 
        containing masses in a column labeled 'Mass' and the corresponding 
        intensities in a column labeled 'Intensity'.

Options:
    -p, --peak-threshold=<intensity>        [default: 0]
        The minimum intensity required for a peak to be considered.

    -v, --visualize
        Plot the mass spectra being analyzed in a new window.
