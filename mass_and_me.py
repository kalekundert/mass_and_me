Search for expected peaks in mass spectrometry data.

Usage:
    mass_plus_me <expected_masses_csv> <mass_spectra_csv>... [options]
    mass_plus_me plot <mass_spectra_csv>...

Arguments:
    <expected_masses_csv>
        A *.csv file (as can be exported from Excel) containing a list of the 
        expected masses in its first column.  This program will generate a 
        report detailing how well each of these masses is supported by the 
        given data.

    <mass_spectra_csv>
        One or more *.csv files (as can be exported from the instrument) 
        containing masses in a column labeled 'Mass' and the corresponding 
        intensities in a column labeled 'Intensity'.

Options:
    -p, --peak-threshold=<intensity>        [default: 0]
        The minimum intensity required for a peak to be considered.

    -v, --visualize
        Plot the mass spectra being analyzed in a new window.

## Inputs
# ======
# List of expected masses

## Goal
# ====
# Rank those by how well they are supported by the data.

## Questions
# =========
# 1. Is the first column mass or mass/charge?
#
#    It's mass/charge.
#
# 2. How does the HPLC data play into things?
#
#    Fitzy can ask the mass spec to bin the data into particular time windows.  
#    The sample data she sent me is a ten minute window, I think.  It would be 
#    nice if this program could handle the binning, though, to save the manual 
#    effort of creating 5-6 windows.  To do that, each mass would need to be 
#    annotated with a time.  That may or may not be possible, though.
#

## Algorithm
# =========
# 1. Identify peaks in the mass spec data:
#   
#   a. Look for down/up/down patterns
#
#   b. Take intensity from "up" positions

# 2. For each expected mass, note the intensity of the nearest peak (or 0 if 
#    there are no peaks nearby).
#
# 3. For each expected mass, note if m/2, m/3, etc. peaks are present.
#
# 4. For each expected mass, note if an ion series is present (+1 +2 +3 for 
#    m/1, +1/2 +2/2 +3/2 for m/2, etc.)
#
# 5. For each expected mass, note if a methyl modification is present (+14 for 
#    m/1, +7 for m/2, +3.5 for m/3, etc.)
#
# 6. Sort each expected mass by how well it fulfills the above criteria.
